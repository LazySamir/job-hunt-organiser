### Activity Categories

#### Jobhunting
1. Sign up to hired (with this link) and talent.io. If you've done all that see my previous email about jobs-board and have a look at one you haven't used before.
2.  Build a list of jobs you want to apply to on your huntr board and then start an application.
3. Build a list of dream companies you'd love to work for. Check out their careers page and LinkedIn, there might be Makers there. If you know there's an office in London ask the careers team who might know something about the process. Looking at the work histories of previous Makers is a good place to get ideas for your list and then you can contact that Maker. Obvs. 
4. Find a job you're into and instead of writing an application, call them up and ask to speak to the engineering team to find out more before you apply. Do some research before you apply to help you build rapport. Explain you're a boot camp grad but would love to apply, ask them what they're working on now. 
5. Connect with a CTO you admire on LinkedIn even though there is no job advertised. 
6. Watch this Vid by our COO Ruben. It's 20 minutes and it's fun.


#### Programming
1. Keep working on a side project, or start one, or listen to this podcast or 10X the hell out of this suggestion and create your own portfolio website.
2. Start or keep working on a week 10 tech test
3. Message us all in _jobhunters to find out if anyone wants to pair with you.
4. Take an hour to read some tech blogs or a book
5. Take an hour to practice answering technical questions
6. Go over the Makers course and remind yourself of key concepts


#### Market Yourself
1. Update your LinkedIn page and connect with 100+ Makers
2. Start a blog post. If you're new to blogging, Medium is good. Start with the story of your journey to becoming a software engineer. Something like Angela's here.
3. Work on a CV to use for jobs you apply to outside of Makers
4. Check your Github profile looks good to employers
5. Head to MeetUps or check out Eventbrite and sign up to tech events or hackathons. Summary of events here but keep your eye on our events channel.
6. Reach out to a dev or someone on LinkedIn or Maker's alumni slack and offer to take them out for coffee in exchange for some guidance, a CV review and guidance to help you choose the right place to work. Listen to what they have to say about their own career journey. In Alumni Slack, we have a slack channel called coffee_buddies where you're paired with a Maker alumni every two weeks. 


#### Self Care & Self Management
1. Meditate
2. Take yourself out for lunch today
3. Do some exercise, 30 mins of yoga or go for a walk
4. Use Pomodoros to give yourself plenty of breaks. Be gentle. Write a list of things you want to get done tomorrow at the end of the day.
5. Call someone from your cohort or slack them to see how they're doing.  Hearing from you will make anyone happy!
6. Do something you enjoy that has zero to do with coding or job-hunting for at least an hour.
